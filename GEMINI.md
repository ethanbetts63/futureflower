# Project Overview

The frontend is a standard React application, which will provide the user interface for creating accounts, setting up events, and managing contact information.

Sometimes a summary file must be created to document the work performed. This summary should cover all major changes, discussions, and decisions made during the session. If the users requests this document please make it as follows:

-   **Location:** `C:\Users\ethan\coding\allbikes\gemini_session_summaries\`
-   **Naming Convention:** The file must be named `summary<N>.txt`, where `N` is the number of the previous summary file plus one (e.g., `summary_28.txt`).
