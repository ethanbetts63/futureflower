## Why FutureFlower for your audience?
Most flower platforms take 20–45% from florists — plus monthly fees, delivery cuts, and penalties — leaving much less money in the bouquet.

FutureFlower does the opposite. We charge a flat **15% with no hidden fees** — no monthly fees, no delivery cuts.

When florists win, customers win:
*   More of their money goes into actual flowers.
*   No supermarket-style bundles.
*   No generic network branding.
*   Pure floristry from local florists.

You're not promoting another impulse purchase. You're sharing a better way to buy something that people are already buying.
