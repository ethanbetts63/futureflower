## Frequently Asked Questions
### Will I get reminders or confirmations?
You will receive a reminder email 1 week and 1 day before the delivery date. They are not confirmation emails so you do not need to respond. They are simply to remind you.

### What is your refund policy?
All orders are 100% refundable up to 14 days before your delivery date, after that point we can not guarantee a refund but we will try our utmost. If your flowers arrive with a major issue (e.g. damaged, dead) this is of course enough reason for a refund. For more information please read the customer terms and conditions.

### What countries do you operate in?
Currently we operate in the EU (Europe), United Kingdom, North America (USA & Canada), Australia and New Zealand.
