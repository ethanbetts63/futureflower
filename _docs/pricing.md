**Subtitle:** The Florist's Choice Advantage

**Text:**
Most online flower deliveries force local florists to recreate rigid "recipes" from a picture. This forces them to use cheaper, hardier flowers that survive long transit, rather than the fresh, seasonal blooms they actually want to use.

**How FutureFlower works instead:**
1.  **Choose the occasion:** Let the florist know the vibe — Romantic, Sympathy, Birthday, and more.
2.  **Add your preferences:** Leave specific notes if you want — "She loves peonies," or "Please no lilies."
3.  **Set your exact budget:** Select your pricing tier or enter a custom amount.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Can I request specific flowers?
Yes. When placing your order you can leave notes like "Loves lilies" or "No pink," and the florist will accommodate your preferences based on seasonal availability. Because we don't enforce a rigid recipe, your florist has the freedom to honour your requests.

### Is delivery really included?
Yes. The budget you type is the exact amount charged to your card. There is no delivery fee added at checkout — it is built into the budget from the start.

### Can I change my order details later?
Yes. You can adjust the most of the details for any upcoming scheduled delivery up to 14 days before the delivery date. Simply log in to your dashboard, open the plan, and update the budget. Changes apply to that delivery and all future ones on that plan.
