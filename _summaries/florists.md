## Why FutureFlower
Right now, when a customer walks into your shop, there's only so much you can upsell: a bigger bouquet, nicer wrapping, maybe an extra gift. And then it's over.

FutureFlower lets you extend your service beyond today's purchase. We give you the infrastructure to offer **scheduled future deliveries**, **ongoing flower subscriptions**, and **multi-year prepaid flower plans** — all without adding admin, complexity, or operational burden.

And we are **completely free to use**. Just set up a QR code in-store and/or a link on your website.

### This changes the conversation in your store.
Instead of wrapping it up and saying goodbye — you can say:
*   "Would you like us to arrange something similar delivered for Mother's Day?"
*   "Would you like us to arrange something similar delivered this time next year?"
*   "Would you like us to set up a delivery subscription? We can have something like this delivered once a month."

## How It Works
**Title:** How It Works
**Subtitle:** Set up once, earn ongoing revenue. No admin, no complexity, no cost.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Link and/or QR Code.
Display your unique discount code (instore poster / website link). The discount comes out of our margin, not yours.

### Step 2: Customer Makes Their Order.
Customers selects budget, preferences, and delivery details. These will all be provided to you.

### Step 3: You Accept or Reject Orders.
Recieve a text and email with an acceptance link. Accept and handle the delivery yourself, or reject for a tiered reward ($5–$25) depending on the bouquet value.

## Comparison Section
**Title:** Stop taking a 45% haircut
**Subtitle:** Same price, more flowers. By cutting the fees big networks charge, we ensure more money ends up in the bouquet.

### Then how do you make money?
No catch, our business model is florist first. We charge a flat 15% per order. No hidden "marketing fees," no monthly subscriptions, and no penalties for saying no. We'd rather be a partner than a tax collector. Any lower and we couldn't offer rejection rewards and discount codes.

### How Big Online Platforms Compare (Table)

**Note:** Reward applies for all customers you signed up. No rejection fee for customers we signed up.

## Our Services
**Title:** Our Services
**Subtitle:** Everything you need to offer long-term flower commitments — without the headache.

### One-Off Scheduled Deliveries
*   **Tagline:** Sell flowers for moments that haven't happened yet.
*   Scheduled deliveries from one week to five years out.
*   We hold the customer commitment, manage changes, and absorb the risk.
*   To you, it's just a normal delivery — fully paid, clearly scheduled.

### Subscriptions
*   **Tagline:** Flowers that show up on time — every time — without anyone having to remember.
*   We specialise in annual subscriptions for significant dates (e.g. birthdays) but we also offer weekly, fortnightly, monthly and bi-annual schedules.
*   We manage reminders, payments, scheduling, and changes.
*   Customers love "this is handled forever" — you benefit from predictable, repeat revenue.

### Prepaid Plans
*   **Tagline:** Upfront commitment for customers. Guaranteed future revenue for florists.
*   Customers prepay for multiple deliveries.
*   No missed payments, cancellations, or admin overhead for you.
*   We manage the capital risk, schedule, and customer communication.

## We Send Business Your Way
**Title:** We Send Business Your Way
We're not just helping you capture in-store opportunities — we're actively marketing flower subscriptions and scheduled deliveries online. When customers in your area find us through Google, Instagram, or referrals, we send them directly to you.
*   Orders from customers who found us, not you
*   Geographic Delivery Preference in your service area
*   Zero marketing spend to acquire these customers

## So what's the catch?
The most honest answer is that **we handle the customer**. The customers learn to use our service, pay with our system, and give us their details.

These are our counter arguments:
*   This is mostly or entirely business you wouldn't have grabbed or been able to serve without us. You're not losing customers — you're gaining new business.
*   We encourage you to use your logos on the bouquet. We differentiate ourselves by standing by local florists. If the flowers are so good the customer wants to skip the middle man and go in-store next time? So be it.
*   In addition to carrying the complexity, headache, and capital risk of delivery commitments — we also carry the risk of bad reviews.
*   If you decide to stop using our service, you can. We'll help you transition customers back in-house by providing you with the details of all customers you signed up. Perfect for a bulk email.
*   Your not indebted to the customer and theres no risk of forgetting the order. The reason most florists don't offer scheduled deliveries is because of the risk and admin. We take care of all of that, so you can just focus on what you do best: making beautiful bouquets.

## For non-delivery partners.
**Title:** For non-delivery partners.
Not every florist wants to deliver — it's expensive, complicated, and time consuming. But that doesn't mean it hurts any less when you have to say no to a customer. FutureFlower gives you the ability to say: **"No, but…"**. A small difference that goes a long way.
*   All you need is a small poster in-store or a link on your website.
*   You get a $5-$25 referral commission on all purchases.
*   We handle all the logistics, customer service, and delivery.
*   Unlock an easy and helpful upsell opportunity.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### What if I can't or don't want to fulfill a delivery?
If a customer you signed up through your link/QR code places an order you can't fulfill, we don't want you to lose out. We pass the order to a trusted partner and pay you a tiered referral fee ($5 for small bouquets, up to $25 for premium arrangements). It ensures your digital shopfront earns you money even when you're fully booked.

### How do refunds work?
If a customer has a legitimate refund request and we are at fault, we pay back the full amount. If you are at fault (unfulfilled order, quality issues, etc.), we refund the full amount to the customer and request that you refund us the amount we paid you.

### Is there a service debt or lock-in?
No service debts. You'll receive a request for all orders from customers you sign up, but if you can't or don't want to fulfil a request, we'll pass it to another florist and give you a $5-25 referral bonus instead. Conversely, requests that other florists can't fill can come straight to you.

### What does it cost?
FutureFlower is completely free to use. There are no setup fees, monthly charges, or hidden costs. Just set up a QR code in-store and/or a link on your website and you're ready to go.

### What countries do you operate in?
Currently we operate in the EU (Europe), United Kingdom, North America (USA & Canada), Australia and New Zealand.
