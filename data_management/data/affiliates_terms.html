    <h2>1. Eligibility & Account Approval</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Full Discretion:</h3>
    <p>Participation in the FutureFlower Affiliate Program is subject to approval. FutureFlower reserves the right to reject any application or terminate an existing account at any time, for any reason, without prior notice.</p>
    <h3>1.2 One Account Rule:</h3>
    <p>Each individual or entity is permitted only one affiliate account.</p>
    <h3>1.3 Code Activation:</h3>

    <h2>2. Commission Structure</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Non-Delivery Partners:</h3>
    <p>These terms apply specifically to non-delivery partners (Affiliates).</p>
    <h3>2.2 The "Rule of Three":</h3>

    <h3>2.3 Tiered Earnings:</h3>
    <p>Commission amounts are determined by the value of the bouquet budget selected by the customer.</p>
    <h3>2.4 Commission Determination:</h3>
    <p>The commission rate and structure applied to an order are those in effect at the time the order is delivered, not at the time the referral was originally made. FutureFlower reserves the right to modify these tiers and rates for all future orders at its discretion.</p>

    <h2>3. Qualifying Conditions</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Eligible Orders:</h3>
    <p>Commission is only earned when: The Customer uses the Affiliate’s unique discount code or link. The Customer is a New Customer (no prior successful payments or accounts). Payment is successfully captured and the delivery is confirmed.</p>
    <h3>3.2 Exclusions:</h3>
    <p>No commission will be awarded for: Self-Referrals: You cannot use your own code. Cancelled/Refunded Orders: If an order is refunded or the payment is charged back, any associated commission is void. Fraudulent Activity: Any attempt to bypass the "New Customer" rule via multiple accounts.</p>

    <h2>4. Payment & Payout Rules</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Stripe Connect:</h3>
    <p>All Affiliates must complete Stripe Connect onboarding to receive funds. FutureFlower is not responsible for delays caused by incomplete onboarding.</p>
    <h3>4.2 Approval Window:</h3>
    <p>Commissions are marked as "Pending" until delivery is confirmed and the refund window has passed.</p>
    <h3>4.3 Payout Schedule:</h3>
    <p>Payments are generally processed within 14 days of a confirmed delivery, provided the minimum payout threshold of $10 has been met.</p>
    <h3>4.4 Offsets:</h3>
    <p>If a commission has been paid on an order that is subsequently charged back or refunded, FutureFlower reserves the right to deduct that amount from future earnings.</p>

    <h2>5. Prohibited Behaviour</h2>
    <p>To protect the FutureFlower brand, the following actions result in immediate termination and forfeiture of all pending commissions: Brand Bidding: Bidding on "FutureFlower" or variations of our brand name in paid search (e.g., Google Ads, Bing). Impersonation: Creating "lookalike" domains or social media profiles that lead customers to believe they are interacting with the official FutureFlower corporate entity. Deceptive Marketing: Using "fake" scarcity, false discount amounts, or "leaking" codes not assigned to you. Spam: Unsolicited emailing, cookie stuffing, or use of automated bots. Coupon Sites: Posting codes on generic coupon/deal aggregator sites without explicit written permission.</p>

    <h2>6. Code Ownership & Data</h2>
    <h3>6.1 No Customer Ownership:</h3>
    <p>Referred customers are customers of FutureFlower. Affiliates do not "own" the customer and have no rights to customer data beyond what is provided in the affiliate dashboard.</p>
    <h3>6.2 Code Management:</h3>
    <p>FutureFlower owns all discount codes and may modify, replace, or deactivate them at any time to prevent abuse or update marketing campaigns.</p>

    <h2>7. Operational Flexibility</h2>

    <h3>7.2 Notice:</h3>
    <p>While we may notify affiliates of material changes, we are not obligated to provide individual notice for every update. Continued participation in the program constitutes acceptance of the current terms.</p>

    <h2>8. Compliance & Liability</h2>
    <h3>8.1 Disclosures:</h3>
    <p>Affiliates are responsible for complying with local advertising laws, including the clear disclosure of their affiliate relationship to their audience (e.g., using #ad or #affiliate). The assertions and general communication used by affiliates must at all times remain truthful and should not mislead consumers.</p>

    <p>The Affiliate agrees to indemnify FutureFlower against any claims arising from the Affiliate’s misleading marketing or breach of these terms.</p>
