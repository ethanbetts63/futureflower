    <h1>FutureFlower: Customer Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 18, 2026</p>
    <p>Welcome to FutureFlower. By using our website and purchasing our services, you agree to the following terms. Please read them carefully.</p>

    <h2>1. Platform Scope & Service Nature</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Coordination Service:</h3>
    <p>FutureFlower is a technology platform that coordinates floral orders between Customers and a network of third-party fulfillment partners (“Florists”).</p>
    <h3>1.2 Independent Contractors:</h3>
    <p>Florists are independent contractors. FutureFlower does not physically create, style, or handle the bouquets. We provide the infrastructure for order management, payment, and customer support.</p>
    <h3>1.3 Florist Selection:</h3>
    <p>FutureFlower reserves the right to assign any partner to fulfill an order. While we prioritize local independent florists, we may use larger corporate marketplaces or alternative fulfillment centers at our sole discretion to ensure service continuity.</p>

    <h2>2. Product Expectations: "Florist’s Choice"</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Design Discretion:</h3>
    <p>All bouquets are "Florist’s Choice." The florist has creative freedom to select flowers based on seasonality, availability, and their professional style.</p>
    <h3>2.2 Illustrative Images:</h3>
    <p>Any images displayed on the platform are for illustrative purposes only. They represent a style or budget tier, not the exact bouquet you or your recipient will receive.</p>
    <h3>2.3 Preferences & Notes:</h3>
    <p>Customers may provide occasion type and preferences (e.g., "I like lilies" or "Avoid tulips"). While we pass these to the florist, preferences are a courtesy and not a contractual guarantee. FutureFlower and its partners are not liable for the inclusion or exclusion of specific flower types, colors, or scents.</p>
    <h3>2.4 Substitutions:</h3>
    <p>Substitutions of stems, colors, or vases are permitted and expected.</p>

    <h2>3. Pricing, Fees & Delivery</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Delivery Included:</h3>
    <p>The price displayed for a bouquet includes standard delivery. We do not charge a separate delivery fee at checkout.</p>
    <h3>3.2 Allocation of Funds:</h3>
    <p>The total price paid represents the cost of coordination, preparation, and delivery. FutureFlower retains a platform fee for its services. We do not guarantee a specific percentage distribution of funds between the platform and the florist.</p>
    <h3>3.3 Price Modifications:</h3>
    <p>FutureFlower may adjust pricing at any time. For active subscriptions, we reserve the right to adjust prices annually to account for inflation and to maintain bouquet quality standards.</p>

    <h3>3.4 Fulfillment Variances:</h3>
    <p>Customer acknowledges that floral products are subject to fluctuating costs and seasonal availability.
The total price paid represents the maximum value of the service package.
Due to the nature of floral assembly, minor variances between the tier price and the final cost of goods/delivery may occur.
Any such variances (typically under $5.00) are absorbed by FutureFlower as a service and coordination fee to maintain the platform and are non-refundable.</p>

    <h2>4. Subscriptions & Recurring Charges</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Authorization:</h3>
    <p>By signing up for a subscription, you authorize FutureFlower to charge your provided payment method at the frequency selected.</p>
    <h3>4.2 Changes & Cancellations:</h3>
    <p>You may modify or cancel a subscription through your dashboard. Changes must be made at least 14 days prior to the scheduled delivery date. Any changes requested within 14 days of delivery are at the sole discretion of FutureFlower and are not guaranteed.</p>
    <h3>4.3 Account Responsibility:</h3>
    <p>You are responsible for keeping your delivery address and recipient details updated. FutureFlower is not liable for deliveries made to outdated addresses provided by the Customer.</p>
    <h3>4.4 Automatic Price Adjustments:</h3>
    <p>FutureFlower reserves the right to adjust subscription pricing periodically to account for inflation, seasonal market fluctuations, and rising logistics costs. No Individual Notice: These adjustments may be applied to your recurring billing cycle automatically and without individual prior notice. Quality Preservation: These adjustments are made to ensure the fulfilling florist can maintain the "Value Parity" and quality standards of your bouquet. Acceptance: Continued participation in the subscription service following a price adjustment constitutes your acceptance of the new price. It is the Customer’s responsibility to review their active subscription rate within their dashboard.</p>

    <h2>5. Delivery Logistics</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Restricted Locations:</h3>
    <p>We cannot guarantee delivery to hospitals, military bases, PO Boxes, or high-security buildings. If a delivery is rejected by the facility, the order is considered fulfilled.</p>
    <h3>5.2 Recipient Availability:</h3>
    <p>If the recipient is not available, the florist may leave the flowers in a safe place or with a neighbor at their discretion.</p>
    <h3>5.3 Delivery Windows:</h3>
    <p>Delivery times are estimates. While we aim for specific dates, factors like extreme weather or local disruptions may result in shifted delivery windows.</p>

    <h2>6. Refunds & Disputes</h2>
    <h3>6.1 Final Sale:</h3>
    <p>Final Sale & Refunds: Due to the perishable nature of flowers, all sales are considered final. Refunds are only issued in two circumstances: (a) Significant quality issues reported with photographic evidence within 24 hours of delivery, or (b) Cancellations made via the customer dashboard at least 14 days prior to the scheduled delivery date.
