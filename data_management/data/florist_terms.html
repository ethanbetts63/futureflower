</head>
<body>
    <h1>Florist Terms & Conditions — FutureFlower</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> [18/2/2026]</p>
    <p><strong>Plain-English summary (non-binding):</strong> A short, explanatory summary may be published for convenience only and does not form part of this agreement. If there is any conflict between the summary and these Terms & Conditions, these Terms & Conditions control.</p>

    <h2>1. Definitions & Relationship</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Parties.</h3>
    <p>“FutureFlower” refers to the platform named above. “Florist” means an independent business or individual accepted to fulfill orders through the platform.</p>
    <h3>1.2 Relationship.</h3>
    <p>Florists are independent contractors. Nothing in this agreement creates employment, agency, joint venture, or partnership. Florists control their operations and are responsible for licenses, taxes, insurance and staff.</p>

    <h2>2. Scope of Services</h2>
    <h3>2.1</h3>
    <p>FutureFlower provides an order-matching and payments platform that connects customers with participating florists. Florists accept orders through the platform and deliver goods/services to the customer.</p>

    <h2>3. Commission & Discounts</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Commission.</h3>
    <p>Platform commission is presently 15% of the order subtotal (bouquet + add-ons). Commission is deducted before payout.</p>
    <h3>3.2 Discounts.</h3>
    <p>Any promotional discount applied to an order is taken from FutureFlower’s commission and does not reduce the florist payout or declared bouquet value. FutureFlower may offer discounts at its discretion and may change discount policy or commission rates at any time; continued use constitutes acceptance of changes.</p>
    <h3>3.3 Calculation.</h3>
    <p>Commission is calculated before tax. Payouts to florists are based on the order amount after commission (and before applicable taxes that the florist must report).</p>

    <h2>4. Order Assignment, Acceptance & Rejection</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Customer-acquired orders.</h3>
    <p>If the customer was signed up or referred to FutureFlower by the florist, that florist receives the first right of refusal and has 24 hours to accept or decline the order. If the florist does not respond within 24 hours, FutureFlower may reassign the order immediately or, at its discretion, extend the response window.</p>
    <h3>4.2 Platform-assigned orders.</h3>
    <p>Orders assigned directly by FutureFlower may be assigned and/or reassigned immediately to any partner florist; those florists may accept or decline but have no priority entitlement.</p>
    <h3>4.3 Binding acceptance.</h3>
    <p>Acceptance of an order is a binding commitment to fulfill that order.</p>
    <h3>4.4 Rejection rewards & penalties.</h3>
    <p>Only orders for customers personally signed up by the florist are eligible for a rejection reward; orders not signed up by the florist are not eligible. There are no penalties for rejecting orders. Reward amounts will be tiered by order value and may be changed by FutureFlower. Abuse of the rejection system (e.g., gaming acceptance/cancellation) may lead to suspension or termination.</p>

    <h2>5. Customer Brief & Quality Standards</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Customer brief.</h3>
    <p>For each order, the florist will receive the customer’s delivery details, total budget (bouquet + delivery), and stated bouquet preferences and notes.</p>
    <h3>5.2 Matching preferences.</h3>
    <p>Florists must reasonably match customer preferences. Exact replication is not required; reasonable substitutions are allowed, however unreasonable substitutions are not (e.g. customer states they are allergic to a flower, and that flower is in the bouquet). If preferences are unreasonable or cannot be met, the florist should decline the order before accepting. If a florist accepts and later discovers they cannot meet the brief, they must notify FutureFlower immediately.</p>
    <h3>5.3 Bouquet value.</h3>
    <p>Florists must supply an arrangement equivalent in value, size and presentation to what they would deliver at the same budget to a direct customer (including delivery). FutureFlower recognizes some subjectivity and will generally give reasonable deference to the florist but reserves final discretion in disputes.</p>
    <h3>5.4 Branding & reviews.</h3>
    <p>Florists are encouraged to include their branding. Customer feedback is monitored; repeated quality complaints may result in suspension.</p>

    <h2>6. Delivery Obligations & Confirmation</h2>
    <h3>6.1 Delivery responsibility.</h3>
    <p>Florists are responsible for safe, timely delivery and compliance with local laws, including maintaining suitable vehicles, staff and insurance. Florists may refuse unsafe delivery tasks.</p>
    <h3>6.2 Confirmation.</h3>
    <p>Florists must confirm delivery status as soon as reasonably possible and no later than 24 hours after the scheduled delivery date using the FutureFlower system (confirmation link or dashboard). Confirmation may include optional notes and delivery time. It is advised but not necessary, that florists maintain internal proof of delivery. Repeated failure to confirm deliveries may lead to suspension.</p>
    <h3>6.3 Delivery failure.</h3>
    <p>If delivery fails, the florist must record the reason (e.g., recipient unavailable, access issue, incorrect address) and inform FutureFlower via the FutureFlower system (confirmation link or dashboard).</p>
    <h3>6.4 Payout Contingency:</h3>
    <p>Payouts are not contingent upon delivery confirmation. However, FutureFlower reserves the right to modify payout procedures in the future.</p>

    <h2>7. Refunds, Fault Allocation & Chargebacks</h2>
    <h3>7.1 Who handles refunds.</h3>
    <p>All customer refunds are processed by FutureFlower. Florists must not issue refunds directly to customers.</p>
    <h3>7.2 If FutureFlower is at fault.</h3>
    <p>FutureFlower will absorb refunds arising from platform errors (payment processing duplications, system errors, incorrect information sent to florist, website/app errors).</p>
    <h3>7.3 If the florist is at fault.</h3>
    <p>Florist is at fault where delivery failed due to florist action, bouquet quality is below reasonable standards, incorrect address handling when correct information was provided, or damage caused during delivery. If a refund is required for an order already paid, the florist must repay FutureFlower. FutureFlower may deduct refunds from future payouts or reverse pending commissions; failure to reimburse may result in collection actions.</p>
    <h3>7.4 Chargebacks & disputes.</h3>
    <p>If a customer disputes a payment, FutureFlower may withhold or reverse payouts pending investigation. Payouts may be reversed where a chargeback is attributable to florist conduct or fraud.</p>

    <h2>8. Payouts & Stripe Connect — Stripe</h2>
    <h3>8.1 Onboarding.</h3>
    <p>Florist must complete Stripe Connect onboarding (or other payment onboarding required by FutureFlower) before receiving payouts. Florists are responsible for maintaining accounts able to receive payments and for any bank or Stripe fees.</p>
    <h3>8.2 Timing.</h3>
    <p>Payouts are processed on a fixed schedule after order acceptance. While the intent is to payout before delivery, actual timing may vary due to Stripe or banking processing; payouts may occur before or after delivery.</p>
    <h3>8.3 Withholding.</h3>
    <p>FutureFlower may withhold payouts in suspected fraud, disputes, chargebacks, or other reasonable concerns. FutureFlower is not responsible for delays resulting from Stripe or banking processes.</p>
    <h3>8.4 Taxes.</h3>
    <p>Florists are solely responsible for reporting and paying taxes on payouts.</p>

    <h2>9. Customer Ownership & Solicitation</h2>
    <h3>9.1 Customer ownership.</h3>
    <p>Customers acquired through the platform remain customers of FutureFlower. Florists may not solicit, redirect or attempt to transfer platform customers to off-platform subscriptions, ordering methods, or services.</p>
    <h3>9.2 Branding permitted.</h3>
    <p>Passive branding (logos, packaging) is allowed and encouraged, but florists must not include communications or inserts that actively encourage customers to bypass FutureFlower. Natural customer attraction due to quality, branding, or service is permitted, if not expected, — but proactive attempts to divert business are not.</p>

    <h2>10. Data Use & Privacy</h2>
    <h3>10.1 Permitted use.</h3>
    <p>Customer data provided to the florist may be used only to fulfill the order. Any independent marketing requires the customer’s explicit consent.</p>
    <h3>10.2 Compliance.</h3>
    <p>Florists must handle data in accordance with applicable privacy laws and FutureFlower’s privacy policy and must not retain customer data longer than necessary for fulfilment and legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>11. Termination & Suspension</h2>
    <h3>11.1 Suspension.</h3>
    <p>FutureFlower may immediately suspend a florist for repeated abuse of rejection mechanisms, quality complaints, fraud, brand damage, or other operational concerns.</p>
    <h3>11.2 Termination.</h3>
    <p>Either party may terminate the relationship on notice. Termination does not affect obligations incurred before termination (including refunds, reimbursements, and any outstanding liabilities).</p>

    <h2>12. Liability & Indemnity</h2>
    <h3>12.1 Florist liability.</h3>
    <p>Florists are responsible for product liability, delivery damage and any statutory liabilities arising from their performance. Florists indemnify FutureFlower against third-party claims arising from florist acts or omissions.</p>
    <h3>12.2 Platform limitation.</h3>
    <p>FutureFlower’s liability is limited to direct, provable damages up to the total commissions paid on the disputed order. Neither party is liable for indirect, special or consequential losses.</p>

    <h2>13. Operational Flexibility & Changes</h2>
    <h3>13.1</h3>
    <p>FutureFlower may modify platform features, commission rates, reward structures, notification methods, terms of ordering, and related policies. Notice may be provided by email, dashboard announcement or platform update. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

    <h2>14. Fraud & Investigations</h2>
    <h3>14.1</h3>
    <p>FutureFlower may investigate suspected fraud. If fraud is tied to a florist, payouts may be reversed and the florist may be suspended or terminated. Florists must cooperate with investigations.</p>

    <h2>15. Primary Service Area</h2>
    <h3>15.1</h3>
    <p>Florists may be assigned a Primary Service Area. Where multiple florists are available for a location, FutureFlower will generally prioritize the florist registered closest to the delivery address but retains full discretion to select any partner by operational, quality, availability or commercial considerations. Primary Service Area does not guarantee volume, exclusivity or minimum allocation but it is FutureFlowers intent that all business be routed to any Florist whose area is applicable.</p>

    <h2>16. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <h3>16.1 Governing law.</h3>
    <p>These Terms & Conditions are governed by the laws of the State of Western Australia and the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia.</p>
    <h3>16.2 Severability.</h3>
    <p>If any provision is invalid or unenforceable, remaining provisions remain in force.</p>
    <h3>16.3 Entire agreement.</h3>
    <p>These Terms (and the privacy policy and any platform rules) constitute the entire agreement between the parties regarding platform orders.</p>
    <h3>16.4 Notices.</h3>
    <p>FutureFlower may give notices via the platform dashboard or email. Florists must keep contact information current.</p>

    <p><strong>Acceptance:</strong> By registering for and accepting orders through the FutureFlower platform, the florist agrees to these Terms & Conditions.</p>
