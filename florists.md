## Why FutureFlower
Right now, when a customer walks into your shop, there's only so much you can upsell: a bigger bouquet, nicer wrapping, maybe an extra gift. And then it's over.
FutureFlower lets you extend your service beyond today's purchase. We give you the infrastructure to offer scheduled future deliveries, ongoing flower subscriptions, and multi-year prepaid flower plans — all without adding admin, complexity, or operational burden.
And we are completely free to use. Just set up a QR code in-store and/or a link on your website.

### This changes the conversation in your store.
Instead of wrapping it up and saying goodbye — you can say:
*   "Would you like us to arrange something similar delivered for Mother's Day?"
*   "Would you like us to arrange something similar delivered this time next year?"
*   "Would you like us to set up a delivery subscription? We can have something like this delivered once a month."

## Our Services
Everything you need to offer long-term flower commitments — without the long-term headache.

### One-Off Scheduled Deliveries
Sell flowers for moments that haven't happened yet.
*   Scheduled deliveries from one week to five years out.
*   We hold the customer commitment, manage changes, and absorb the risk.
*   To you, it's just a normal delivery — fully paid, clearly scheduled.

### Subscriptions
Flowers that show up on time — every time — without anyone having to remember.
*   We specialise in emotionally significant dates: Mother's Day, anniversaries, birthdays.
*   We manage reminders, payments, scheduling, and changes.
*   Customers love "this is handled forever" — you benefit from predictable, repeat revenue.

### Prepaid Plans
Upfront commitment for customers. Guaranteed future revenue for florists.
*   Customers prepay for multiple deliveries.
*   No missed payments, cancellations, or admin overhead for you.
*   We manage the capital risk, schedule, and customer communication.

### Transferable Subscriptions & Plans
The gift that keeps giving — even when the giver steps back.
*   Customers can transfer control to the recipient after purchase.
*   Recipients manage preferences, delivery dates, pauses, or address changes.
*   Removes friction, reduces support, and keeps subscriptions active longer.

## How we work together: A Simple 4-Step Process

### Customer Books Delivery
*   Sets budget, dates, and flower preferences
*   Pays for each bouquets budget (eg. $100) and customer protection/refund fee
*   Our fee is in addition to the budget. Florists are always paid the full budget amount for accepted orders.

### You're Notified (2 Weeks Before Delivery)
*   Full order details sent via text & email: budget, address, preferences
*   Click acceptance link to confirm or deny the order (no penalty for denying)
*   No admin, dashboards or sites to manage - one link handled from email or text
*   If you decline a customer you signed up, receive a 5% commission instead

### 2nd Notice (1 Week Before Delivery)
*   Additional requests sent to ensure receipt of the acceptance link
*   You have 48 hours to accept or decline
*   Same 5% commision for declining.
*   No response = decline

### Delivery Day
*   Create a bouquet that matches the budget and preferences (as closely as possible)
*   Deliver using your normal process
*   Full budget amount paid weekly for all accepted orders.

## We Send Business Your Way
We're not just helping you capture in-store opportunities — we're actively marketing flower subscriptions and scheduled deliveries online. When customers in your area find us through Google, Instagram, or referrals, we send them directly to you.
*   Orders from customers who found us, not you
*   Full budget payment for every delivery you accept
*   Geographic exclusivity in your service area
*   Zero marketing spend to acquire these customers

## For non-delivery partners.
Not every florist wants to deliver — it's expensive, complicated, and time consuming. But that doesn't mean it hurts any less when you have to say no to a customer. FutureFlower gives you the ability to say: "No, but…". A small difference that goes a long way.
*   All you need is a small poster in-store or a link on your website.
*   You get a 5% referral commission on all purchases.
*   We handle all the logistics, customer service, and delivery.
*   Turn a 'no' into a 'yes, we can do that through our partner'.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### What if I can't or don't want to fulfill a delivery?
No problem at all. If you can't fulfill a delivery request from a customer you referred to us, we'll pass the business on to another florist and cut you a 5% referral bonus. You can always say no to a delivery request without penalty.

### How do refunds work?
If a customer has a legitimate refund request and we are at fault, we pay back the full amount. If you are at fault (unfulfilled order, quality issues, etc.), we refund the full amount to the customer and request that you refund us the amount we paid you.

### Is there a service debt or lock-in?
No service debts. You'll receive a request for all orders from customers you sign up, but if you can't or don't want to fulfil a request, we'll pass it to another florist and give you a 5% commission instead. Conversely, requests that other florists can't fill can come straight to you.

### What does it cost?
FutureFlower is completely free to use. There are no setup fees, monthly charges, or hidden costs. Just set up a QR code in-store and/or a link on your website and you're ready to go.

### What countries do you operate in?
Currently we operate in the EU (Europe), United Kingdom, North America (USA & Canada), Australia and New Zealand.
