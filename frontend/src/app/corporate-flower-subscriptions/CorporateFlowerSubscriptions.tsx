    question: 'How do corporate flower subscriptions work?',
    answer:
      'Set the office address, budget, preferences, and first delivery date, then choose a weekly, fortnightly, or monthly recurring schedule during checkout. A local florist creates a fresh arrangement for every delivery.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can we get recurring flower delivery for an office reception?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Use the preferences field to describe the reception area, brand colours, arrangement style, and anything the florist should avoid. The florist then designs each delivery for that brief and the budget you set.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will the office flowers look the same every time?',
    answer:
      'Not exactly. The florist follows your standing brief but works with fresh, seasonal availability, so each arrangement can evolve while remaining appropriate for your workplace and preferences.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can an office flower subscription be cancelled?',
    answer:
      'Yes. You can cancel the subscription from your account. If the office will be closed for a period, cancel the current subscription and create a new one when deliveries should resume.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can we arrange flowers for multiple office locations?',
    answer:
      'Each delivery address needs its own subscription. For a coordinated rollout across several offices, contact FutureFlower so we can understand the locations, schedules, and budgets involved.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How often can corporate flowers be delivered?',
    answer:
      'You can choose weekly, fortnightly, or monthly delivery. The right rhythm depends on the space, budget, and how consistently you want fresh flowers on display.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do we choose an exact arrangement from a catalogue?',
    answer:
      'No. You provide a practical design brief and a local florist creates each arrangement from suitable seasonal flowers. This gives the florist room to produce the strongest result from what is fresh that week.',
