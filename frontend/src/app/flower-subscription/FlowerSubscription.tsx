    question: 'How does a flower subscription with FutureFlower work?',
    answer:
      'Set a budget and delivery frequency — weekly, fortnightly, or monthly — and a local Australian florist designs a fresh bouquet for each delivery. Every drop is built from what is best and in season that week, so no two arrivals are identical.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I pause or cancel my flower subscription?',
    answer:
      'Yes. A subscription is a recurring version of a normal order, so you stay in control. Pause when you are away, skip a delivery, or cancel at any time — there is no lock-in contract.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I send a flower subscription as a gift?',
    answer:
      'Absolutely. Enter the recipient\'s address, choose how many deliveries you want to gift, and add a card message. Each delivery arrives under the local florist\'s own name with your note attached.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will every bouquet in my subscription look the same?',
    answer:
      'No — that is the point. Instead of repeating one catalog recipe, your florist designs around the freshest seasonal stems each cycle while keeping to your budget and any preferences you set, like favourite colours or flowers to avoid.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Where do you deliver flower subscriptions?',
    answer:
      'FutureFlower is focused on Australia. Recurring delivery availability depends on the delivery address and local florist coverage.',
