    question: 'Can I send flowers to Australia from another country?',

      'Yes. You can place the order online from overseas, enter the recipient\'s Australian delivery details, and choose a future delivery date. A florist near the recipient makes and delivers the arrangement locally.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are the flowers shipped internationally?',
    answer:
      'No. The flowers do not travel across borders. Your order is sent to an independent Australian florist near the delivery address, who creates the arrangement from fresh flowers available locally.',

    question: 'What currency will I pay in?',

  {
    question: 'How far ahead should I order flowers for Australia?',

      'Please order at least three days before the delivery date. Ordering earlier is helpful for important occasions and gives the local florist more time to plan around seasonal availability.',

    question: 'Where in Australia can FutureFlower deliver?',

      'FutureFlower serves Perth, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, and surrounding suburbs where a local florist is available. Final availability depends on the exact address and delivery date.',

  {
    question: 'Can I include a personal card message?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Add your message while placing the order and it will be included with the flowers. This is useful when you cannot be in Australia for the occasion yourself.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I choose the exact bouquet?',
    answer:
      'You choose the occasion, budget, colours, preferences, and anything to avoid. The local florist then designs an arrangement from the freshest suitable flowers available, rather than copying a fixed catalogue bouquet.',
