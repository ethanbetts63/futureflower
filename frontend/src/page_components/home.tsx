    question: 'Do I choose the exact bouquet?',
    answer:
      'No. You choose the occasion, budget, and custom preferences. A florist uses that brief to design something suitable from the flowers available to them.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I tell the florist what to avoid?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Add dislikes, allergies, colours to avoid, or anything else the florist should know in the preferences box.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will I get exactly what I ask for?',
    answer:
      'The florist designs from what\'s fresh and available on the day, matching your preferences as closely as they can. Broad guidance — colours, a feeling, things to avoid — gives them the most to work with. Very specific requests may mean a close substitute if that exact flower isn\'t in season or in stock.',

    answer:
      'FutureFlower is focused on Australia. Availability can depend on the delivery location and florist coverage.',
