          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-0">How We Ranked These Payment Reminder Tools</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">We evaluated apps on reliability, visibility of reminders, cross-device sync, ease of use, cost, and feature set. The goal was to highlight tools that actually prevent missed payments and late fees, rather than just looking pretty. Both standalone bill trackers and finance apps with reminder features were included, giving a mix of dedicated and integrated solutions.</p>

          <div className="space-y-12">
            {/* 5. Honeydue */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">5. Honeydue — Social finance with bill alerts</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Hard-to-Ignore:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Ease & Aesthetics:</strong> 4/5</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 5/5</p>
                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 3/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> Honeydue is popular among couples because it aggregates joint finances and tracks due bills. Users like the clarity and shared visibility, but some feel it’s less focused on reminders specifically and more on overall finance.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> Good free option if you want bill reminders plus shared budgeting features. Not as dedicated to persistent reminder alerts as some others, but valuable if money tracking and planning are equally important.</p>
            </div>

            {/* 4. Bobby */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">4. Bobby — Simple subscription tracker</h3>
              <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-4 mb-4">
                <p><strong>Cross-platform sync:</strong> 2/5</p>
                <p><strong>Hard-to-Ignore:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Ease & Aesthetics:</strong> 5/5</p>
                <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 3/5</p>
                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 3/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> People praise Bobby’s clean UI and ease of adding subscriptions. It doesn’t automate connections to accounts (you enter services manually), but you get simple renewal alerts that people find useful.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> Bobby is aesthetically lovely and easy to set up, but the lack of cross-device sync and automated bill pull means you’ll have to manage it manually. Great for straightforward subscription reminders, less so for complex bills.</p>
            </div>

            {/* 3. Money Manager (TimelyBills) */}
            <div>

              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> Users like seeing their bills on a calendar and getting timely alerts about dues and upcoming expenses. It’s not as slick as modern apps, but it’s practical.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> This is the most traditional bill reminder app on the list — calendar-style, straightforward alerts, and decent recurring support. It’s not the prettiest and sync isn’t perfect, but it’s effective for everyday bill reminders.</p>
            </div>

            {/* 2. Mint */}
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 border-b pb-2">2. Mint — Budget + bill due alerts</h3>

                <p><strong>Featurefulness:</strong> 4/5</p>
              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> Mint is one of the most widely recommended personal finance apps. Users like how it connects to accounts and shows upcoming bills right on your dashboard. Alerts are helpful, though sometimes seen as generic push notifications.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> Mint’s strength is aggregation: all your accounts, bills, and budgets in one place. It’s free, syncs everywhere, and doesn’t need much setup. If you want smart bill reminders integrated with financial overview, this is a top pick.</p>
            </div>

              </div>
              <p className="mb-2"><strong>Community Opinion:</strong> Prism gets frequently recommended as the go-to bill tracking app: it connects to hundreds of billers, shows due amounts and dates, and gives you timely reminders. Users like seeing all bills in one dashboard.</p>
              <p><strong>Our Opinion:</strong> Prism wins this category because it’s designed around bills and payments, not just tasks. It’s free, syncs across devices, delivers useful alerts, and eliminates the need for manual entry in most cases. Whether it’s rent, subscription, utilities, or other recurring costs — Prism keeps them in one place and reminds you before they hit.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-12">Honourable Mention — Calendar + Alerts Combos</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">If you just need basic bill date alerts and already use a calendar (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook), you can create recurring entries with alerts and/or <Link to="/articles/best-text-message-reminder-apps" className="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-primary">SMS</Link>/push notifications. These aren’t purpose-built bill trackers, but they do ensure you see alerts where you already live — your calendar.</p>
