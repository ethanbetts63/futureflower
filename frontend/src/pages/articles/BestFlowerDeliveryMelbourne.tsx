        <div className="text-lg text-primary-foreground space-y-6">
          <p>Melbourne’s flower delivery market blends local florists with strong national providers. Whether you want an elegant, premium bouquet, need same-day delivery at the last minute, or are looking for something budget-friendly, there’s a great choice for every situation.</p>
          <p>Below are the best flower delivery services in Melbourne, based on quality, speed, and value.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">Best Overall Flower Delivery in Melbourne: Fig & Bloom</h2>
          <p><strong>Starting price:</strong> ~$85 per bouquet</p>
          <p><strong>Delivery speed:</strong> Same-day metro delivery (order by ~1 pm)</p>
          <p><strong>Delivery area:</strong> Greater Melbourne (1000+ suburbs)</p>
          <p>Fig & Bloom is widely regarded as the best all-round flower delivery option in Melbourne thanks to its lush, contemporary bouquets and consistently excellent service. Known for soft pink and white colour palettes and beautifully arranged blooms, it’s a favourite for anniversaries, birthdays, and special occasions.</p>
          <p>Designs are sophisticated without being overly fussy, and the option to add wine, chocolates, or other gift items makes it easy to personalise every order. Customers rate the service highly for freshness, presentation, and reliability, reflected in strong independent reviews.</p>
          <p>While the starting price (~$85) is higher than budget alternatives, the overall experience feels worth it for those after an impressive bouquet.</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Premium floral arrangements and memorable gifts.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">Fastest Flower Delivery in Melbourne: Floraly</h2>
          <p><strong>Starting price:</strong> ~$59 per bouquet</p>
          <p><strong>Delivery speed:</strong> Same-day (order by ~3 pm weekdays; ~12 pm weekends)</p>
          <p><strong>Delivery area:</strong> Melbourne metro and surrounds</p>
          <p>Floraly offers one of the latest same-day order cut-offs in Melbourne, making it ideal when time is tight. With weekday orders accepted up to about 3 pm for same-day delivery, it outlasts many competitors in flexibility.</p>
          <p>Floraly’s bouquets are fresh and long-lasting, often delivered in bud form to extend vase life. Their sustainability focus — including sourcing from local farms and supporting OzHarvest with every purchase — sets them apart from many larger networks.</p>
          <p>Bouquet styles tend toward simple and fresh rather than heavily stylised, but the reliability and late cut-off time make Floraly a go-to option for urgent orders.</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Same-day delivery when you’re running late.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">Most Affordable Flower Delivery in Melbourne: Easy Flowers</h2>
          <p><strong>Starting price:</strong> ~$40 per bouquet</p>
          <p><strong>Delivery speed:</strong> Same-day (order by ~2 pm weekdays)</p>
          <p><strong>Delivery area:</strong> Covers most of Melbourne</p>
          <p>Easy Flowers is the most affordable widely available flower delivery service in Melbourne. With bouquets starting around $40 and extensive delivery coverage, it’s ideal for those who want basic, fresh flowers without paying premium prices.</p>
          <p>Arrangements aren’t as elaborate as boutique florists’, and substitutions can happen, but reliability and low cost are the main benefits here. With solid reviews and broad reach, Easy Flowers is a practical choice for casual gifting, small thank-you gestures, or any time price matters most.</p>
          <p><strong>Best for:</strong> Budget-friendly bouquets with same-day delivery.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">How Flower Delivery in Melbourne Works</h2>
          <p>Most Melbourne flower delivery services operate with similar logistics:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>Same-day delivery cut-offs vary, typically between ~1 pm and ~3 pm</li>
            <li>Metro areas qualify for same-day service; outer suburbs may require next-day delivery</li>
            <li>Peak seasons (Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day) often see higher prices and reduced availability</li>
            <li>Local and boutique florists generally offer stronger design quality</li>
            <li>National providers tend to offer wider coverage and later order cut-offs</li>
            <li>Add-ons (chocolates, wine, cards) vary by provider</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Understanding these differences helps you match the service to your priorities — be it style, speed, or affordability.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight">Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>Melbourne has excellent flower delivery options across all key categories:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>Fig & Bloom is the best overall choice for high-quality, beautifully designed bouquets.</li>
            <li>Floraly offers the latest same-day cut-off and dependable fast service.</li>
            <li>Easy Flowers is the most affordable option for simple and quick deliveries.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Whether you’re celebrating a milestone, sending a heartfelt message, or ordering flowers for the first time, one of these services will fit your needs.</p>
          <p>For occasions that repeat every year — birthdays, anniversaries, and annual milestones — a <a href="/" className="underline hover:opacity-70">flower delivery subscription</a> is worth exploring if you’d rather plan ahead than reorder each occasion separately.</p>
