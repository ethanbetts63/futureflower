          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-0">When should you prune apple trees?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Prune apple trees in late winter to early spring, before buds break and while the tree is dormant. This reduces disease exposure and encourages strong spring growth. Focus on opening the canopy for light and airflow, removing crowded branches, and shaping for long‑term structure. Young trees need yearly pruning to establish a productive framework.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">When should you trim apple trees?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Trimming during the growing season should be light and intentional. Remove water sprouts, suckers at the base, and small crossing branches. Summer thinning can help redirect energy to fruit development, but avoid major cuts that stress the tree or expose fruit to sunburn.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">When should you fertilize apple trees?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Fertilize in early spring as growth resumes. Young trees benefit from annual nitrogen applications in modest amounts. Mature trees may require little to no fertilizer if soil is healthy. Avoid fertilizing after midsummer, as late feeding encourages soft growth that’s susceptible to winter injury.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune apple trees in spring?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Yes — late winter into early spring is the ideal pruning window. Once buds swell heavily, delay major cuts to avoid sap loss and reduced bloom potential. Prioritize removing diseased, damaged, or crossing branches.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune apple trees in summer?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Summer pruning is safe if light and targeted. Removing water sprouts, reducing density, and thinning fruiting areas can improve sunlight penetration and reduce disease pressure. Avoid heavy cuts during extreme heat to prevent stress.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune apple trees in autumn (fall)?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Avoid fall pruning. Fresh cuts heal slowly in cool, wet weather, increasing disease risk. Cuts made now often lead to tender growth that winter freezes may kill. Leave structural pruning for late winter.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune apple trees in winter?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Late winter pruning is ideal, but deep winter pruning in extreme cold risks die‑back. Wait until the worst frost danger passes. Winter pruning can stimulate regrowth, so always balance structural needs with fruiting wood preservation.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Caring for apple trees? The most common mistake</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">One of the most common mistakes with apple tree care is timing — people plan to prune, feed or protect their apple trees, then life gets in the way and the window closes. You probably saw this coming. ForeverFlower exists to solve that problem: our <Link to="/articles/best-free-reminder-apps" className="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-primary">free tier</Link> is perfect for these sorts of gardening reminder needs.
