          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-0">When should you prune hydrangeas?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">The correct pruning time for hydrangeas depends on whether they flower on old wood, new wood, or both. Some varieties set their flower buds the previous year, meaning pruning too late removes the blooms before they ever appear. Others flower on new growth and benefit from harder seasonal pruning. Identifying your hydrangea type is essential before making any cuts.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">When should you trim hydrangeas?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Trimming hydrangeas is mostly cosmetic and should be limited to removing dead flowers or damaged stems. Light trimming can be done after flowering to tidy the plant, but structural cuts should be avoided unless you’re certain the variety flowers on new wood. When in doubt, minimal trimming is safer than aggressive shaping.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">When should you fertilize hydrangeas?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Hydrangeas should be fertilized during active growth, typically from spring into early summer. Feeding too early risks frost damage to tender growth, while fertilizing too late encourages soft shoots that won’t survive winter. Soil quality matters more than frequent feeding — a single, well-timed application is often enough for healthy growth and flowering.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune hydrangeas in spring?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Spring pruning is risky for many hydrangea varieties because flower buds may already be present. If pruning is necessary, limit cuts to dead or clearly damaged wood and wait until new growth reveals which stems are alive. For hydrangeas that bloom on new wood, spring pruning is safer, but timing still matters to avoid delaying flowering.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune hydrangeas in summer?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Summer pruning should be minimal and intentional. Removing spent blooms is generally safe, but cutting deeper into the plant can reduce future flowering, especially for varieties that bloom on old wood. In hot climates, excessive pruning can also stress the plant and increase water loss.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune hydrangeas in autumn (fall)?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Autumn pruning is one of the most common causes of missing blooms the following year. Many hydrangeas set their flower buds before winter, so cutting in fall removes next season’s display. In most regions, it’s best to leave hydrangeas untouched and allow the plant to protect itself naturally over winter.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune hydrangeas in winter?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Winter pruning is usually limited to cleanup rather than shaping. Dead wood can be removed once the plant is fully dormant, but live stems should generally be left intact until spring reveals where new growth emerges. In colder climates, leaving stems in place also helps protect buds from frost damage.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Caring for hydrangeas? The most common mistake</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">One of the most common mistakes with hydrangea care is timing — people plan to prune, feed or protect their hydrangeas, then life gets in the way and the window closes. You probably saw this coming. ForeverFlower exists to solve that problem: our <Link to="/articles/best-free-reminder-apps" className="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-primary">free tier</Link> is perfect for these sorts of gardening reminder needs.
