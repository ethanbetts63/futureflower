          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-0">When should you prune roses?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Prune roses during their dormant phase, just before the sap starts to rise and buds swell. In most climates that means late winter or very early spring; you want to remove old, weak wood before new shoots appear so the plant can put energy into healthy canes and stronger blooms. Watch local cues — last hard frost passed and you see swelling buds — rather than a fixed calendar date, because frost timing varies by region.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">When should you trim or deadhead roses?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Trimming and deadheading are ongoing seasonal tasks that encourage repeat flowering without stressing the plant. Remove spent blooms and small crossing shoots during the growing season to keep the plant tidy and direct energy into new buds. Avoid heavy cuts in hot periods; light shaping is fine, but large structural pruning should wait until dormancy to prevent shock and reduced flowering.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">When should you fertilize roses?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Feed roses when they’re actively growing and producing foliage and flowers — usually from early spring through mid-summer. A light, balanced feed after the first flush of growth helps sustain repeat blooms; stop heavy feeding well before the plant moves into dormancy so new tender growth can harden off for winter. Soil type and local climate influence frequency, so combine calendar timing with visual cues (vigorous new growth, not frost risk).</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune roses in summer?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Summer is for maintenance, not heavy surgery. If the bush needs shaping, remove only small shoots and spent flowers; large cuts can reduce blooming and expose fresh wounds to heat stress and pests. In very hot or drought-prone regions, avoid any non-essential pruning — conserving foliage helps shade stems and reduce heat damage.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune roses in autumn (fall)?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Autumn pruning should be conservative. Heavy pruning right before winter can stimulate new growth that won’t harden off and may be killed by frost, so focus on tidying, removing diseased material, and adding protective mulch rather than major cuts. In mild climates you may get away with a bit more shaping, but in colder areas restraint preserves winter hardiness.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Should you prune roses in winter?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">Yes — for most gardeners, the main structural pruning happens while roses are dormant in winter. This is when canes are easiest to see and when removing old or crossing wood will have the most benefit without compromising blooms that year. Aim for a clear framework of healthy canes and cut to outward-facing buds to encourage open growth and better air circulation.</p>

          <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold tracking-tight mb-4 mt-8">Caring for roses? The most common mistake</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">One of the most common mistakes with rose care is timing — people plan to prune, feed or protect their roses, then life gets in the way and the window closes. You probably saw this coming. ForeverFlower exists to solve that problem: our <Link to="/articles/best-free-reminder-apps" className="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-primary">free tier</Link> is perfect for these sorts of gardening reminder needs. Why not just use your calender app? You definitely could. But a single notification is easy to miss. And what if you change phones? We use a notification hierarchy. We’ll start with <Link to="/articles/best-email-reminder-apps" className="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-primary">emails</Link>, then we’ll send you <Link to="/articles/best-text-message-reminder-apps" className="font-bold text-white underline hover:text-primary">texts</Link>. And we’ll keep trying to reach out until you acknowledge us. So that’s the pitch, nothing too complicated. We’d love for you to give it a try. And so would your roses’s.
