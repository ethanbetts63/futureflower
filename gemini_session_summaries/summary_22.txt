## Summary of Changes

This session addressed several issues related to the `total_amount` not being set correctly, a backend validation error, and a frontend routing issue.

### 1. `total_amount` not being set correctly

**Problem:** The frontend `SingleDeliveryStructureEditor.tsx` was attempting to set `totalAmount` using `data.total_amount` from an API response, but the actual API response provided `new_total_price`. This led to `totalAmount` being `undefined`.

**Solution:**
- The `CalculatedPriceResponse` interface in `frontend/src/api/singleDeliveryPlans.ts` was updated to accurately reflect the API response by changing `total_amount` to `new_total_price`.
- The `setTotalAmount` call in `frontend/src/components/SingleDeliveryStructureEditor.tsx` was updated to use `data.new_total_price`, aligning it with the corrected type definition and the actual API response.

### 2. Backend validation error: "Budget, deliveries_per_year, and years are required"

**Problem:** After the previous fix, a backend validation error occurred, stating: `"Budget, deliveries_per_year, and years are required for total_amount validation."` This was happening because `deliveries_per_year` and `years` were not being included in the payload when the frontend called `updateUpfrontPlanAsSingleDelivery`.

**Solution:**
- The `handleSave` function in `frontend/src/components/SingleDeliveryStructureEditor.tsx` was modified to explicitly include `deliveries_per_year: 1` and `years: 1` in the `payload` when calling `updateUpfrontPlanAsSingleDelivery`. This ensures that the backend receives all required fields for validation.

### 3. Frontend routing error: "No routes matched location"

**Problem:** After a successful payment, the application tried to navigate to `/dashboard/upfront-plans/27/overview` but resulted in a "No routes matched location" error. This was due to a mismatch between the defined route in `App.tsx` and the navigation target. The route was defined as `/dashboard/plans/:planId/overview` instead of `/dashboard/upfront-plans/:planId/overview`.

**Solution:**
- The route path in `frontend/src/App.tsx` for the dashboard upfront plan section was corrected. The `path="plans"` was changed to `path="upfront-plans"` for all relevant routes, resolving the routing mismatch.

All changes were followed by successful frontend builds to ensure no new compilation errors were introduced.
