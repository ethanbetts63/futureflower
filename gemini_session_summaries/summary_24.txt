Session Summary - February 13, 2026

Major Changes:
- Completed comprehensive review and testing of all primary Django apps: users, events, partners, data_management, and payments.
- Implemented and verified a total of 172 tests across the codebase.
- Fixed numerous bugs in test factories, serializers, and management commands caused by stale code or missing modules (e.g., Tier/Color removal regressions).
- Added missing documentation (README.md) for the partners app.
- Updated existing READMEs for users, events, and data_management to accurately reflect current testing status and business logic.
- Resolved integration issues with Stripe webhooks and verified the event generation lifecycle for both upfront and recurring plans.
- Corrected permission settings for public endpoints (FlowerTypes, Discount Validation).
- Fixed rate-limiting issues in test environments by clearing the file-based cache.

Key Decisions:
- Deferred anonymization-specific tests as requested, but verified the underlying model structures support the intended hashing logic.
- Standardized test factories to use modern factory_boy patterns (factory.Faker instead of factory.random).
- Decided to remove deprecated management command flags and related tests to maintain a clean and accurate testing suite.

Next Steps:
- The backend is now in a highly stable and verified state.
- Future work could focus on implementing the missing send_reminder_email utility and Notification model mentioned in the recommendations.
- Front-end integration testing can proceed with high confidence in the API's reliability.
