# Session Summary - ForeverFlower

This session focused on resolving a build error and implementing a new feature on the booking confirmation page, continuing from the tasks left in the previous session.

## Key Changes and Files Affected:

### 1. `EditButton` Build Error Fix

*   **Problem:** The `EditButton` component had been refactored to require a `to` prop, which was not being provided in the `FlowerPlanManagementPage.tsx` file, causing a build failure.
*   **File Affected:** `foreverflower/frontend/src/pages/user_dashboard/FlowerPlanManagementPage.tsx`
*   **Actions Taken:**
    *   Identified that the `EditButton` was intended to link to the plan editing page.
    *   Based on the routing structure defined in `App.tsx` and the logic in `EventGate.tsx`, the correct path was determined to be `/book-flow/flower-plan`.
    *   The `EditButton` was updated to include the `to` prop, dynamically creating the link with the plan's ID: `<EditButton to={'/book-flow/flower-plan?planId=${plan.id}'} />`. This resolved the build error.

### 2. Custom Message Display on Confirmation Page

*   **Problem:** The `BookingConfirmationPage` needed to display the custom messages that a user may have added to their flower plan events.
*   **File Affected:** `foreverflower/frontend/src/pages/flow/BookingConfirmationPage.tsx`
*   **Actions Taken:**
    *   Imported the `MessageSquareText` icon from `lucide-react` to be used in the new section's header.
    *   A new `Card` component was added to the page, placed between the "Preferences" and "Final Price" sections.
    *   The card is titled "Custom Messages" and includes an `EditButton` that links to the message editing page (`/book-flow/flower-plan/${planId}/add-message`).
    *   Logic was implemented within the card to check if any events in the `plan.events` array contain a message.
        *   If messages exist, the component filters and maps over the events, displaying the formatted delivery date and the message content for each.
        *   If no messages exist, a fallback text ("No custom messages were added.") is displayed.

All tasks from the previous session summary have been addressed. The application should now build successfully and correctly display custom messages during the booking confirmation step.
