## Founder's Letter
**Heading: How do I say 'I love you' when I’m no longer there to say it?**

I imagined a man in his sunset years, looking at the woman who walked beside him for decades. He wanted to ensure that on every anniversary after he was gone, she would **still hear his voice** through the language of flowers.

It felt radical, perhaps even impossible. But it was too beautiful to ignore.

So we built FutureFlower, to turn a temporary bloom into a permanent bridge—allowing love to **defy the calendar** and keep a promise that even time cannot break.

We soon realized that you don't have to be dying for it to be a great gift. FutureFlower is just as much for the son who wants to ensure his mother feels **cherished every May**, or the partner who wants to guarantee a decade of birthdays are celebrated with style.

It's for the person who wants to be known as **the one who always remembers**—the one whose love isn't just felt today, but is promised for every year to come.

Ethan Betts.
*Founder and Developer*
