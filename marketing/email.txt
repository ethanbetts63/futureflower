Hi there,

I’ll paste my generic pitch below but just quickly — I always listen to an episode before reaching out to podcasts, __________________________________________

But anyway, here's the quick pitch: 

I run FutureFlower.

The vast majority of online flower orders are routed through large networks that take 25-50% commissions from local florists and require strict “bouquet recipes”. The result is florists get squeezed and customers get bad bouquets. We built a model that only charges 15%, gives creative control back to the florist, and includes free delivery.

What we are offering: 
- You get up to $75 per signed up customer
- Your audience gets $5 off and free delivery. Not to mention just a better deal on online flowers. 
- Payouts via stripe 

If this sounds like a fit for your audience, I’d love to talk. Feel free to ask any questions and you can see more info on our affiliate page. You’re not selling something customers don’t want. It’s just a smarter way to buy something they're already buying.
