Elevator pitch: 
FutureFlower fills a few niche gaps in the flower market. There are no annual flower subscriptions, there are no options for upfront payment for subscriptions, there are no options for sending flowers far into the future, there are no flower subscriptions built so that you can pass custody over to the person receiving the gift and all flower subscriptions are regionally based. FutureFlower can operate in any region where flowers can be delivered. It’s essentially a bouquet organizing middle man, which means super low running costs, a high degree of automation and a larger target audience.

Founder Letter: 
How do I say 'I love you' when I’m no longer there to say it? I imagined a man in his sunset years, looking at the woman who walked beside him for decades. He wanted to ensure that on every anniversary after he was gone, she would still hear his voice through the language of flowers. It felt radical, perhaps even impossible. But it was too beautiful to ignore. We built this to turn a temporary bloom into a permanent bridge—allowing love to defy the calendar and keep a promise that even time cannot break. 

We soon realized that you don't have to be dying for it to be a great gift. FutureFlower is just as much for the son who wants to ensure his mother feels cherished every May, or the partner who wants to guarantee a decade of birthdays are celebrated with style. It's for the person who wants to be known as the one who always remembers—the one whose love isn't just felt today, but is promised for every year to come.

User Flow: 
1. You decide once. - Choose the dates, budget, and how long you want this to last. Then optionally attach meaningful messages to be sent with each delivery. 
2. Lock it in - We create a long-term plan and store every future delivery in our system. Payment can be upfront or subscription based depending on your preference. 
3. It just happens - Every year, on time, we arrange the flowers — no risk of forgetting, no effort. Our expertise is reliability and arrangement. We partner with companies that deliver high quality flowers for the rest.

Booking flow: 
Dates, times per year, number years, budget per bouquet, Users details. (step 1 we create a profile in the background for the user so that all subsequent steps are always tied directly to a profile which makes the logic simpler.)
Bouquet preferences (selection of bouquets that user can essentially just approve or disapprove to give the admin an idea of what they like when they come to receiving the bouquet. That makes sense from a colour perspective. But youll also want to give them a flower option where they can say preferably sunflowers or something. 
Message writing. Here you need to give them the option to write a custom message for every single delivery. Or one single message for all the deliveries. Or maybe a mix of both somehow.

*   "Would you like us to set up a delivery subscription? We can have something like this delivered once a month."

*   You have 48 hours to accept or decline

## For non-delivery partners.
Not every florist wants to deliver — it's expensive, complicated, and time consuming. But that doesn't mean it hurts any less when you have to say no to a customer. FutureFlower gives you the ability to say: "No, but…". A small difference that goes a long way.
*   All you need is a small poster in-store or a link on your website.
*   You get a 5% referral commission on all purchases.
*   We handle all the logistics, customer service, and delivery.
*   Turn a 'no' into a 'yes, we can do that through our partner'.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### What if I can't or don't want to fulfill a delivery?
No problem at all. If you can't fulfill a delivery request from a customer you referred to us, we'll pass the business on to another florist and cut you a 5% referral bonus. You can always say no to a delivery request without penalty.


### How do refunds work?
If a customer has a legitimate refund request and we are at fault, we pay back the full amount. If you are at fault (unfulfilled order, quality issues, etc.), we refund the full amount to the customer and request that you refund us the amount we paid you.


### Is there a service debt or lock-in?
No service debts. You'll receive a request for all orders from customers you sign up, but if you can't or don't want to fulfil a request, we'll pass it to another florist and give you a 5% commission instead. Conversely, requests that other florists can't fill can come straight to you.


### What does it cost?
FutureFlower is completely free to use. There are no setup fees, monthly charges, or hidden costs. Just set up a QR code in-store and/or a link on your website and you're ready to go.
