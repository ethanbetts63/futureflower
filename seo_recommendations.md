## 12. Occasion-Specific Landing Pages (Long-Term, High Value)

High search-volume keywords with clear purchase intent that currently have no matching page:

| Keyword | Monthly Volume (AU est.) |
|---|---|
| "birthday flower delivery Australia" | High |
| "anniversary flower delivery" | High |
| "Mother's Day flowers Australia" | Very High |
| "Valentine's Day flower delivery" | Very High |
| "sympathy flowers delivery" | Medium |

These would be purpose-built landing pages (not articles about competitors) that drive directly to the booking flow. Long-term play but high ROI.

## 14. Homepage FAQ Expansion

The homepage currently has 3 generic FAQs (reminders, refunds, countries). These produce FAQPage structured data via the `FaqV2` component — which is great. But adding keyword-rich questions would capture more rich snippets:

- `"What cities in Australia does this flower delivery service cover?"`
- `"How does a flower subscription work?"`
- `"Can I schedule a flower delivery for a future date?"`
- `"What's the difference between a one-time delivery and a flower subscription?"`
