This document outlines the 5-step process for handling a user account deletion to ensure both data privacy and system integrity.

1. Initiation
A user requests to delete their account through the application's interface. This action triggers the deletion workflow.

2. Delete all pending Flowerplans
The system immediately finds all Flowerplans for this user that have a 'non-active' status. These are immediately deleted as they are unpayed for. Then we look for active flower plans. Any active flower plans should be anonomized. Non completed events should be deleted. Completed events do no need to be anonomized as they do not hold any sensitive info.

3. Anonymize User Data via Hashing
For all personally identifiable information (PII) on the User model (e.g., first name, last name, email), the system calculates a secure, salted hash of the value. This hash is then stored in a corresponding 'hash_' field (e.g., 'hash_first_name'). A special 'hash_email' field is also populated with the hash of the user's email address. Salt is used in the hashing process. 

4. Overwrite Personal Data
After the hashes are stored, the original fields are all set to null, expcept the email field which we give the value of user_pk_{user_pk}@deleted.com to satisify our unique constraint.

5. Deactivate Account
Finally, the user's account is marked as inactive (e.g., 'is_active = False'). This action prevents any future logins and effectively removes the user's access to the system, completing the deletion process.
